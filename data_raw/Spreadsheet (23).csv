I went skiing and hiking at Grouse mountain, then at the end of a long day - I relaxed in front of fireplace with my favourite book. The dream continued... I prepared for work the next day in my home office, made a cup of coffee and looked out from my desk on to nature, but my thoughts were not about work. I was planning dinner for the friends we were having over that evening, because we love to entertain! The only troubling part of my dream was that I couldn't figure out if we should dine inside or eat el fresco on the patio. What would you do?","Showings by appointment only.
