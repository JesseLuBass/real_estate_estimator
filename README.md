# Vancouver Real Estate Estimator
This project is a part of the [Data Science Program](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en/data-science-bootcamp) at [Lighthouse Labs, Vancouver](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca).  

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to create a landing page data application for Bridgestone Realty, ltd. The application, using data science, gives accurate listing evaluation of real estate properties within the Greater Vancouver Area to a Median Average Error of 50000 CAD, based upon custom imput from the users. The machine learning capabilities of the application and the consequent interface allows the model to constantly stay up-to-date on predictive real estate trend within Vancouver. Its abilioty to instantly provide accurate evaluation also creates a starting place for the realtor and any potential customers for further partnership.

## Project Description
Due to the unique nature of the Vancouver Real Estate Market, there is currently no commercial application of predictive property evaluation methods available for this segment . This lack of automated process for quick-and-easy evaluation contribute to the barrier many customers experience as they venture into the real estate market, where they have to right away make time-dependent commitment to specific agents without prior knowledge. From the perspective of the customer, there is also potential for conflict of interest when they approach any realtor for an evaluation of their desired property as a buyer, or evaluator of their exisitng property as a seller.
The goal of this application, therefore, is to provide an expedient and objecive metric for those who are looking to make an important financial step in their lives. Just by visiting the landing page of Bridgestone Realty, Ltd, customers can have an accurate and objective metrics for their real estate need; this opens up the possibilities for their further interest or commitment with Bridgestone. 
Using propietary database from the Greater Vancouver Area that have been properly anonymized to ensure security, the data is segmented and tested to ensure the integrity of the machine learning methods without any leakage. The data then undergoes a complex and comprehensive period of preprocessing that involves feature engineering and selection tools such as sentiment analysis, tokenization, and data aggregation.
Once completed, 22 machine learning algorithms and several iterations of different Feed Forward Neural Network architectures are compared to ensure maximum accuracy and relevance with the exisitng data. The winner of this process, a Random Forest ensemble method is chosen for further optimization and fine-tuning. The resultant product is then tested on previously unseen data where it reaches an average median error of 52230 CAD, which is within 3 percent of the average mean value of the testing target. 
An interface is build around the model for demonstration purposes, and an interface for predictive evaluation of properties is in its proof-of-concept stage.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
